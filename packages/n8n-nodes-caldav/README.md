## What You Can Do

### 📅 Manage Your Calendar

- Get all your calendars
- Create, view, update, and delete events

### 🔔 Automate with Triggers

### Triggers (Start Workflows Automatically)

The CalDAV Trigger node watches your calendar and starts workflows when things happen:

- **Event Created**: Triggers when a new event is created
  - Great for: Sending welcome emails to meeting attendees, logging new bookings

- **Event Updated**: Triggers when someone changes an event
  - Great for: Notifying attendees of schedule changes, updating external systems

- **Event Started**: Triggers when an event begins
  - Great for: Sending meeting reminders, starting Zoom calls, posting to Slack
  - **Minutes Before**: Configure a lead time to trigger X minutes before the event starts (0 = trigger exactly at start time)
  - **Bonus**: For recurring events (like "Daily Standup"), this triggers for each occurrence

## Real-World Examples

### 💼 Automatic Meeting Room Booking

When someone books a meeting through your website:

```
Webhook (booking form)
  ↓
CalDAV: Create Event
  ↓
Send confirmation email
```

### 📧 Daily Schedule Email

Get your day's schedule every morning:

```
Schedule Trigger (Every day at 6 AM)
  ↓
CalDAV: Get All Events (today only)
  ↓
Send email with your schedule
```

### 🔔 Smart Meeting Reminders

Get reminded before any meeting starts (works great with recurring meetings!):

```
CalDAV Trigger: Event Started (Minutes Before: 5)
  ↓
Send SMS/Slack message
```

**Special feature**: If you have a "Daily Standup" recurring event, you'll get a reminder every single day automatically!

### 📊 Calendar Analytics

Track all your meetings in a database:

```
CalDAV Trigger: Event Created
  ↓
Save to database (Postgres/MySQL/etc.)
  ↓
Build reports on meeting trends
```

### 🎯 Task Management Integration

Sync your calendar todos with your project management tool:

```
CalDAV Trigger: Event Created (on "Tasks" calendar)
  ↓
Create card in Trello/Asana/Jira
```

## Recurring Events

You can create events that repeat automatically! Here are some examples:

### Common Recurring Event Patterns

When creating an event, use the "Recurrence Rule (RRULE)" field:

- **Daily standup for 10 days**: `FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10`
- **Weekly team meeting (every Monday)**: `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO`
- **Bi-weekly sprint planning**: `FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=MO`
- **Monthly review (every 15th)**: `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=15`
- **Annual company party**: `FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=12;BYMONTHDAY=25`
- **Gym every Mon/Wed/Fri**: `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR`

### How Triggers Handle Recurring Events

- **Event Created/Updated triggers**: Get notified once when you create or modify the series
  - Example: When you create "Weekly Team Meeting", you get 1 trigger

- **Event Started trigger**: Get notified for each occurrence (recurring events are expanded)
  - Example: "Weekly Team Meeting" triggers every Monday
  - Perfect for sending reminders or starting Zoom calls automatically!

## Troubleshooting

### "Calendar not found" error

Make sure you're using the correct server URL for your calendar provider (see Setup Guide above).

### Authentication failed

- **iCloud users**: You must use an app-specific password, not your regular password
- **Google Calendar users**: Enable 2-factor authentication and create an app password
- **Nextcloud users**: Check that your username and password are correct

### Events not showing up

- Try using "Get All" without filters first to see if events are being retrieved
- Check that you're looking at the correct calendar
- For time-range filters, make sure your dates are in the correct format

### Trigger not firing

- Triggers poll your calendar periodically (check your n8n polling interval settings)
- Make sure the calendar URL in your trigger matches exactly
- For "Event Started" triggers, the event must start within the polling interval
